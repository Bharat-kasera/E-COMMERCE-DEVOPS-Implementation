---
This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment.

### üéØ Project Goals

Our goals are threefold:

- **Real-world Demonstration**: Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability
- **Extensible Foundation**: Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations
- **Living Laboratory**: Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements

We've already made [huge progress](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), and development is ongoing. We hope to represent the full feature set of OpenTelemetry across its languages in the future.
## üöÄ Quick Start

You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for your preferred deployment method:

- **[Docker Deployment](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)** - Quick local setup
- **[Kubernetes Deployment](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)** - Production-ready orchestration

## üìö Documentation

## üê≥ Running the Project Locally

This project can be run locally on your personal machine or an EC2 instance using **Docker Compose**. Docker Compose is the preferred method for managing multi-service applications like this e-commerce project, which includes frontend, backend, and database services.

Using Docker Compose, you can easily spin up all the necessary containers with a single command, ensuring proper startup order and network configuration across services. Even if you're new to Docker Compose, you only need to execute a simple command to get the project running initially.

This approach simulates a real development environment and helps you understand the workflow of the project by exploring it hands-on in your browser. It also aligns with industry best practices for running complex applications locally and supports integration within CI/CD pipelines.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine or EC2 instance
- Git to clone the repository

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the project with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Access the application** through your web browser as per the provided URLs in the project documentation.

This setup will launch all components (frontend, backend, databases) with correct dependencies, giving you a seamless local development experience.

## üåê Accessing the Project on the Browser

By default, this project runs on port **8080** and can be accessed via a web browser using the instance's public IP followed by `:8080` (e.g., `http://<your-public-ip>:8080`). Note that it is important to use `http://` explicitly, as the project does not use HTTPS by default.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Configure AWS Security Groups

AWS EC2 instances come with attached **Security Groups**, which act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic. By default, these security groups block all inbound traffic except for specific ports like **22 (SSH)** used for secure shell connections.

If you cannot access the project on port 8080, it is likely because this port is not open in your instance's security group inbound rules. To fix this:

1. Navigate to your AWS EC2 dashboard
2. Find the security group associated with your instance
3. Edit the **Inbound Rules** to allow TCP traffic on port **8080** from your preferred sources, such as:
   - Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) if you want public access, or
   - Your specific IP address or IP range for restricted access
   
Once you save these rules, refresh your browser at `http://<your-public-ip>:8080` to access the application.
